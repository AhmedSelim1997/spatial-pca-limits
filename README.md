# Limits of PCA on spatial data
In this project, we investigate the limits of pricipal component analysis (PCA) when applied to genotype data obtained from samples of a spatially structured population. 
This repo has all the files needed to reproduce the data and the results. It is organized as follows:

## scripts/
- *utils.py:* contains all functions and objects used by other scripts
- *create_parameter_array.py:* a script that creates the combination of simulation parameters used later by slurm job-arrays
- **data_generation/**: A directory that contains all scripts used to generated raw data that is later analyzed. A single snakefile is used to generate all data for one set of parameters. Job-arrays on slurm are used to generate data for a set of parameters in parallel.
- **analysis/**: A directory that contains all scripts used to analyze raw data and produce the figures used in paper


## docs/
- **jobs/**: slurm job-arrays used to generate all data in bulk (hidden)

- **job_outputs/**: log files outputted by slurm jobs (hidden)

- **parameter_csv_files/**: parameter files outputted by *create_parameter_array.py*, and used in job arrays to generate raw data in parallel

## results/
- **full_data/**: A directory which includes files that combine raw data, and that can be used directly for analysis and producing figures (by scripts in **/scripts/analysis/** directory)
- **figures**: all figures generated by analysis scripts and used in the paper 

## data/
*this directory is hidden*

Contains raw data arranged in the following structure:

> analyzed_demography/
>> param1/
>>> param2/
>>>> raw_data_for_parameter_combination
